📍1. Contact Us Page
Removed: The “Back to Home” button at the bottom of the page.

📍2. Refund Policy Page
Created: New file refund-policy.html.

Structure: Matches the UI of privacy-policy.html and terms-of-service.html using the same layout, navigation, and footer.

Content: Currently includes placeholder/dummy text that can be replaced later by the content team.

📍3. Footer – Legal Section
Updated Across All Pages:

Added “Refund Policy” link in the Legal section of the footer.

Consistent with links for Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.


📍4. About Us Page – Button Visibility Fix
Section Affected: “Take the First Step Toward Better Health Management”

Updated:

Replaced the original “Join Waitlist” button styling with the same blue box used on the homepage (bg-[#0284c7], hover [#0369a1]).

Now appears clearly and matches brand color.

Additional:

The button has also been linked correctly to index.html#join-waitlist (same destination as the homepage Join/Partner buttons).
